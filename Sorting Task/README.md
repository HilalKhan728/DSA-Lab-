# Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort & Selection Sort

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort** algorithms in C++. The programs read a list of integers from a text file (`numbers.txt`), sort them, and measure the time taken to perform the sorting. The project is intended for learning the fundamentals of sorting algorithms, file handling, and performance measurement in C++.
